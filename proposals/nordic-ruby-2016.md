## Speaking proposal for Nordic Ruby 2016

*by Reginald Braithwaite*

### Making the simple, simple. And the complex, possible.

*Simplicity* is like art: Difficult to define, but we know it when we see it. This talk begins by illustrating some techniques for composing--and decomposing--code to make it simpler to understand and work with. But simplicity is not a static property of code: We then move on to look at simplicity in thinking about code, in writing code, and in our practices working with others. By the conclusion, we will understand that simplicity is a value that permeates everything we do from naming a value to building a career.

(There will be some Ruby code, but only to lend verisimilitude in small examples.)
