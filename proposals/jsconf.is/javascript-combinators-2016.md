### Speaking proposal for jsconf.is 2016

*by Reginald Braithwaite*

# JavaScript Combinators, the "Six" Edition

We'll explore combinators, JavaScript's first-class functions that consume and return functions. Our focus will be decomposing code so that we can separate concerns and name the salient entities, then recompose it so that we can name the relationships between its parts.

We'll explore writing both functional *and* OO code in JavaScript's natural style.
