### Speaking proposal for Nordic Ruby 2016

*by Reginald Braithwaite*

# `1.01 ** 365 => 37.78343433288728`

A popular meme explains that `1.01 ** 365 == 37.78`, but `0.99 ** 365 == 0.02`. Small differences in our productivity, carried out every day, lead to huge differences in outcome. Obviously we have a `37.78x` incentive to find better programming tools, techniques, and practices, even to hire better programmers.

But there is also an enormous fear of `0.02x` programming, of tripping over non-standard idioms and styles. This creates a relentless cultural drive for standardization, aiming for `1x` results at the expense of `37.78x` outcomes.

In this talk we'll explore that tension, and identify practices for picking and choosing when to go for `37x`, and when to settle for `1x`.
