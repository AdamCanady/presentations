> A *decorator* is a higher-order function that takes a function, and returns another function that adds to or modifies its argument's behaviour.

---

## partial application decomposes a function from the outside-in

```javascript
let pluck = (collection, property) =>
  collection.map( (obj) => obj[property] );

// decomposes into:

let pluckFrom = (collection) =>
  (property) => pluck(collection, property);

## extract closed-over binding

```javascript
let pluckFrom = (collection) =>

// becomes:

let leftApply = (fn, a) =>
  (b) => fn(a, b);

let pluckFrom = (collection) =>
  leftApply(pluck, collection);
```

---

## extract closed-over binding

# Closed over bindings can be extracted, just like parameters

---

# Decomposing `pluckFrom` into `leftApply` gives us a decorator
